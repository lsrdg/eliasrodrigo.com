You want to see a juggling act. But what does that mean?
Most of the circus' skills require a lot of time to be learned, and even more
until the artist feel comfortable enough to perform them.

That's why it is not rare to see an artist performing and improving only one
number through their entire professional life. And that's totally
understandable. 

In circus people usually do everything: from preparing the tent to cleaning up
after the show. Not rarely, a circus artist also develops other skills besides
the one shown on stage. Circus' people usually master every detail involved:
creating sound trackers, dealing with the lights and everything else.

As a juggler I have always been curious to learn different juggling techniques. 
I am mostly a club juggler, but I do love juggling with balls, cellphones, hats,
rings, contact and even audience juggling. But as an independent artist a
question mark was set pretty early on my career: not every juggling act fits
every situation.

That's why I took the longest path I could: in instead of focusing on one
act/trick until it becomes second nature, I decided to fight for the plurality:
learn as many things as possible, even if it will take longer.

# Juggling with acts

Each small trick you have seen a juggler perform, took many 
hours/days/weeks/months or most probably years to learn.

There is nothing to do against it. A juggler needs a period of time dropping and
bending the knees until *properly* learn something.

It took me years to learn how to balance a ball on the head. It seemed simply
impossible. Something that was not me. But I did learned, and I do practice in
order to improve my head-balancing technique.

Ideally, a contact juggling act would come to a point where I would do some head
balancing, also moving the ball on my head (from the top to the forehead and so
on).

But when performing in 40oC, with the sun upon the head, it is not possible. The
contact ball burns. Literally, it burns the skin quickly. And that's why,
even though it would be something definitely worth of putting on stage, I need
to do something else, ehe.

That's why I do struggle to develop the discipline and patience required to
learn every single trick on my acts. But I don't fit into the established way of
act creation. I definitely don't want to do the same thing over and over. More
than that, it is beyond my power to decide the conditions I'll be on.

And that's why I won't repeat an act the way it was since last time.

Usually I perform in the most distinct conditions. Literally: with or without
music, with or without lights, with rain or wind etc...

The only answer I have found to solve this problem was to juggle even with my
numbers.

Club juggling? Love it! But it is not always possible to do it when the wind
decides to watch.

# Would you dare to be surprised?

Really, would you pay the price of something beyond your expectations? Because
if you do decide to hire me, that's some you're gonna need to deal with.

I won't come with an untouchable act. We will talk - hopefully a lot - and then
let's see what the audience really needs. What would surprise them?

I am training. Practicing hard. And they won't forget it. Me neither. That will
also be an unique experience for me.

See you there.
