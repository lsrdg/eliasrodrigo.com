**Vivo** was a juggling documentation project done in 2013 in the Brazilian 
Amazon, directed by the great photographer [Lucas JatobÃ¡](http://lucas-jatoba.com).

## 3 years of juggling

It was the first time my juggling would be on focus, and I wasn't comfortable
at all. But Lucas knew what he was doing, and that's how he described Vivo:

> Vivo! was born on the will to live, to dedicate yourself to a goal, to
> perfect whatever you do and fell yourself realized by doing what you love.

I could not say it in a better way. When he send this description, I could
not express how relieved I was: he nailed something that was wordless to me.
