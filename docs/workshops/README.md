# Level up your juggling with private classes

Juggling can be pretty tricky and most likely impossible; at least without the
right techniques and mindset - it may take up to several years to get the basics down (that 
happened to me!).

If you have ever seen a juggler flowing/jamming

Build up precision in your movements, improve your peripheral vision
capabilities, learn to listen to your body.

Since juggling is such a personal experience, it is **totally up to you** to
decide which goals and which direction should juggling be about.

## How much?

The classes will be on a hat bases: you decide how much it is worth and how much you
can afford: no questions will be asked. Groups (up to 10 people) more than
welcome.

I do accept cash, but you are always welcome to use Paypal or MobilePay. Head to
the [Webhat](../webhat) for more information.

## How long?

It takes time to build muscle memory. Classes will last *at least* one hour. But of
course, it totally up to you.

## Where?

It is up you, but in these days we better meet outdoors if you are in
Copenhagen. We can also do it online.

## Choose an open program

Open program? WTF? Juggling is not about the goal, is about the path.

People have different 'things' they want to achieve: simply learn how to juggle,
cultivate a healthy hobby, recover from past injuries, learn specific (and 'hard') tricks, put a
juggling routine together, make a show.

It doesn't matter: with body and mind techniques you can achieve 


::: tip Basics: learn to juggle

For those who want to have a good start in one or more juggling disciplines:

- 3 and four balls
- 3 clubs
- Contact juggling
- Balance!
- Diabolo
- Devil and flower stick

::: warning Hobby: don't get bored/frustrated

If you are just starting out:
You can juggle but you are not getting anywhere, maybe you've been doing the same
tricks/patterns for way too long. New tricks seem impossible. After such time
invested into juggling, most of us get afraid of loosing what we have learned.

::: tip Health: body, mind and spirit

With a proper warm up and stretching targeted to the kind of juggling (that
**you** want to do) we can prevent injuries. By doing that we actually go way beyond
our beliefs.

By knowing where the focus and by sharpening the mind set: you can learn how to
make use of your capabilities without damages to your body.
- Warm-up
- Stretching
- Focus

::: warning Performance: put a routine or show together

Whether you want to put a one minute routine or one hour show... you will need
feedback. We all do. I know how it is to be unable to put a sequence together
either because:

- we feel that we are not ready and just 'don't have' enough material or
- because we have way more material than the timespan of routine/show would
    allow

How to filter what is relevant and irrelevant for a routine? Maybe you know that
you **can** do a trick, but it when you get to it in your routine you are
already exhausted.

How to make contact without the crowd if you are too shy or too focused?

A performance can be a thousands pieces puzzle. Even worse: they can fit
together wrongly.

Don't worry. It is all *way* simpler from someone else's eyes.
